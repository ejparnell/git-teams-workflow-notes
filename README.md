# Git Team Workflow

Daily stand up - should be 15 mins at max. You talk about what you did yesterday, what you are going to do today and any blockers

Sprint - is a chunckable piece of time to work on a set amount of tickets

Team manager - Manage the kanban board, manage the git workflow, manage the tickets

SME
Front end React SME - the team goes to for React questions
Back end Express/MongoDB SME - the team goes to for Express/MongoDB questions

Kanban board - is just a place to org your tickets, who is working on what, and what stage

Day in the Life of team project
In the morning - stand up 
Inside of stand up - talk about stand up things 
- kanban board - look at the tickets, see what needs to be merged, see what needs to be moved, merge, assign tickets to team


As a manager - You will merge all branches that need to be merge then push for `origin main`
As a dev - You will pull from `upstream main`

Both manager and devs can then checkout to feature branchs and work on them
